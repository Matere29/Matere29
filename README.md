### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Matere29/Matere29** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am an open minded individual with the ability to think on my feet. I work very well in a team environment, and I get along with others easily. I am an analytical person and I enjoy problem solving. I am studying Software Engineering with Code Space because it is a path suited for me. I am passionate about learning new skills within the IT industry and I am always looking forward to enhance what I already know.
